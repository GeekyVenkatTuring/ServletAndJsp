Servlet:



Difference between ServletConfig and ServletContext


ServletConfig:
ServletConfig is object created by Tomcat Server and all the init params defined in the web.xml are stored in the Servelet config object
in web.xml-<init-param> tag will be under <servlet-class>tag
Scope of ServletConfig object is till Servlet is executed

ServletContext:
ServletContext is like application context which is scoped attribute.
Values put in the ServletContext will be present across application
in web.xml-<context-param> tag will appear under <web-app> tag



No. of web applications  =  That many number of ServletContext objects [ 1 per web application ]
No. of servlet classes = That many number of ServletConfig objects
