MVC-
M-Model
V-View
C-Controller

Servlet is controller which takes the request
Bean is the Model to which servlet passes the request to get the data
JSP is the view which presents the data to the client

To understand more about MVC pattern,lets create project in the eclipse and finally we will upload the project into the github

Usecase:
We will create login page which takes UserID and password
Our application need to authenticate the UserID and password. Send the user is System user or not

Controller
-LoginServlet--it takes userid and password from the request
Business Service
--AuthenticationService--it authenticate user
Model
--AuthenticationResult
View
--Login Page
--Greetings Page


In eclipse,we created Dynamic Web Project called "LoginAPP"
