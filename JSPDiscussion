JSP commands

JSP-Java Server Pages

1.Using JSP, we can have java code inside html pages
use below script tag, to write custom java code
<%


%>

2.Use declaration script tag to define java method and use that anywhere in the jsp page
<%!
public int add(int a,int b){
return a+b;
}
%>

<%
k=add(32,25);

%>

3.When we deply JSP into server like Tomcat,it converts JSP into java code
to be more precise,it convert into Servlet
And the code put in the scriptlet tag, is added in the doGet method
but Servlet doGet and doPost methods and we may not known in which method we have to put this
So Tomcat will put this in the jsp life cycle method  jspService()
other life cycle methods are jspinit and jspdestroy similar to Servlet life cycle methods

When we create Project,create sample JSP method in the Web content folder

When JSP file is deployed in the TOmcat server,it compiles and creates java class to Jsp file

TO find the Java class, find it in the below temporary folder
/home/vishvaksen/eclipse-workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.wst.server.core/tmp0/

In this Github folder,I am copying this compiled java class,Please use it as reference
